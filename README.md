# Studentised maximum range distribution

We consider the Studentised maximum value of several ranges.

* nrml_p.c  
  Normal probability (lower, upper or centre)
* rng_lp.c  
  Lower probability of range
* smrng_lp.c  
  Lower probability of Studentised maximum range  
  (Similar to ptukey() of R package)
* smrng_lq.c  
  Lower quantile of Studentised maximum range  
  (Similar to qtukey() of R package)
* smrng\_lq\_tst.c  
  Test program of smrng_lq()
* smrng_tbl.c:  
  tabulates the quantiles of Studentised maximum range
